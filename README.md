# 🎮 Survival Game

Survival Game is a fight game, built for coders who want a straightforward and efficient way to write and test HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Using Javascript, I made sure Survival Game is easy to use and gets the job done. The app is not responsive. 

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Move the characters as you want**: You can jump, attack, go to the left and to the right.
- **Sounds**: You can hear sounds when you get hit. There is a sound at the end of the game.
    
## 📦 Built With

- `CSS`
- `Javascript`
- `HTML`

## 2️⃣ Multiplayer 

You can play with another person sitting next to you.

- The player (the girl, on the right of the screen) can jump with the ArrowUp Key, go to the left with the ArrowLeft key, go to the right with the ArrowRight key and attack with the ArrowDown key.
- The enemy (on the left of the screen) can jump with the "w" key, go to the left with the "d" key, go to the right with the "a" key, and attack with the space bar. 
- The one with the most health after 60 seconds wins, unless one player is defeated before the time runs out.
- Whether it's a win, loss, or a tie, a modal displaying the result appears once the game is over. You will need to refresh the page to start over.

## 🤔 How Can It Be Improved?

The project could be improved by adding an option for players to replay the game or return to the main menu after a match. Additionally, introducing a third enemy that launches attacks and increasing the frequency of these attacks would enhance the game's complexity and excitement.
